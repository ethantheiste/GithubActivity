The librarian sat in his office and pondered. He had a problem on his hands, and he wasn't quite sure how to solve it. He had 11,000 or so unique books in his library, and no efficient way to digitally catalog them. He had considered implementing a linked list, or a binary search tree, but the runtime complexity would have been too large for the immense size of his collection. And what if mulitple books had the same title or author? A binary search tree might not be able to differentiate between them. He needed an efficient and effective solution as soon as possible, otherwise his library would be forced to shut down and his family would starve. 
He ran around the library, searching for a book that may help him on his journey. Shelf by shelf, he grabbed a book and read it. He looked through each book while hoping that the answer will appear in front of him. The books were piling up but no solution was found. He saw the clock ticking and saw his time running out. He had no idea on what to do. He felt the fear as he tried to come up with ideas.
